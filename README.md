# 2020-Queen-nutrient-storage-timing-experiment

## Contains all analyses performed on datasets for nutrient storage timing in bumble bee queens [Watrous et al. in prep]

### Synopsis

We explored flexibility in the critical nutrient storage period preceding overwintering in *Bombus impatiens* queens. Specifically, we tested the ability of adult bumble bee queens to recover from diets that are temporarily deficient in either pollen or artificial nectar (for three, six, or nine days) during the early-life, pre-diapause nutrient sequestration period.

### Analysis
